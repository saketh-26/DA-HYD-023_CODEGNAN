OOP -->class (attributes,methods (Constructor,Instance Method)),
object creation/utilisation -->Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism
OOP --> Abstraction,Usage of Class methods,Static Method

#Class methods --> these are termed by using @classmethod decorator
It applies for entire class level data,thereby every object utlisation
will be modified..

#lets work on an example related to Ecommerce

class Ecommerce:
    """Usage of classmethod & class attribute"""
    company = "Flipkart" #class attribute
    delivery_charge = 50 #class attribute
    @classmethod
    def update_delivery(cls):
        cls.delivery_charge = 100
        print(f'New Delivery Charges {cls.delivery_charge}')
Product = Ecommerce()
print(Product.company)
print(Product.delivery_charge)
print(Ecommerce.company) #classatrributes can be directly accessed using class name
print(Ecommerce.delivery_charge)
Product.update_delivery() #accessing classemethod
print(Product.delivery_charge)
Mobile = Ecommerce()
print(Mobile.delivery_charge)

#Applying Inheritance and usage of classmethod,classattributes
#banking scenario --> RBI -->SBI,HDFC....

#If incase as above scenario we have same name for class attributes in
#both parent and child classes,the best approach is to call
#the class attributes is using class names such as (RBI.cash)
'''
#Static Method -->It doesnot depend either on the object or to the class.abs
#we can create it using @staticmethod decorator
#it is mainly used as utility or helper functions
